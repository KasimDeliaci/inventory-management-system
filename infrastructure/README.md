# Infrastructure

This directory is reserved for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying the application to a production environment.

- **/kubernetes**: Will contain Kubernetes manifests for service deployment.
- **/terraform**: Will contain Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.

**Note:** The implementation of these components is out of scope for the initial PoC. This structure is in place to define the target production architecture.
